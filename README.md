# Project-3_WeatherEvents_JAN2016-DEC2022
This is UNC-CH-DA Group Project 3 for Group 4: A_Bourgeois, R_Pearce, R_Gutierrez, S_Bowman


## **Project Proposal**
The aim of our project is to uncover trends in weather patterns recorded at airport weather stations from 2016-2022. We will examine relationships between types of weather events, severity, times of year they occurred, duration, and if they tend to recur at the same time year-after-year forming an annual or multi-year cyclic pattern for the nation as a whole as well as separate geographical locations. Findings will be displayed on an interactive dashboard with multiple views.
